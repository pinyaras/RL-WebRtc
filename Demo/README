# Run The Experiment #
######################

The commands described in the Challenge-Example documentation
have been included here as two bash scripts "send" and "receive"

The receiver and the sender should be launched in separate windows.
The receiver must be running in order for the sender to operate.

# For local test
./receive
./send

# For netns test
sudo ip netns exec ns1 ./receive
sudo ip netns exec ns2 ./send

# To run with Linux TC, launch the TC Link script
# In a separate window, with a specified trace fil
sudo updateLink.py <traceFile.txt>

# NOTE: The default setting for updateLink.py is
# to apply rules on br0. This can be changed by modifying
# the device(s) defined in the "sw_lists" variable 

A sample trace file has been included here for demo purposes
4G_700k_trace.txt
