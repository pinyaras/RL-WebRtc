# Experiment Steps #
####################

This process describes collecting
and comparing outputs from two
AlphaRTC Bandwidth Estimators

Gemini
/home/lab/dev/rl_vdo/Gemini/submitted_code

HRCC
/home/lab/dev/rl_vdo/HRCC

Each environment is set up with the appropriate
config files, bash scripts, and input media files

The BandwidthEstimator.py files have also been modified
To log outputs needed for generating the plots.

Run each experiment as described in the Demo section.

When finished, collect the output files and send them
as inputs to genPlots.py

pythomn genPlots.py /path/to/logfiles

For testing purposes, the genPlots.py expects a path as input
That path should contain two AlphaRTC output files to be compared

For now these are hard-coded as "GCC.log" and "RL.log"
The trace file is also expected, currently hard-coded as "TestCapacity.txt"
